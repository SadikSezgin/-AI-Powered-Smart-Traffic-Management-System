Smart Traffic Management System (AI Graduation Project)
==========================================================

This project is an AI-powered Smart Traffic Management System designed to optimize urban traffic flow using real-time data and machine learning models. It dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings based on traffic density, vehicle patterns, or simulation inputs to reduce congestion, waiting time, and fuel consumption.

Developed as a graduation project by SadÄ±k Sezgin

Key Features
---------------

- AI-based decision making for adaptive signal control
- Vehicle detection and traffic density estimation
- Machine Learning models trained on real/simulated data
- Performance tracking using recorded traffic metrics
- Modular and extensible architecture

Dataset & Records
---------------------

Due to file size limits, the records/ folder (containing traffic data, logs, or video files) is not included in this repository.

You can download the records/ directory separately via:
You can find the related links in their own folder.

After downloading:
- Place the contents into a folder called records/ in the root directory.

How to Run the Project
--------------------------

1. Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/SadÄ±kSezgin//-AI-Powered-Smart-Traffic-Management-System
    cd smart-traffic-ai

2. Install dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    (Activate your virtual environment first, if needed.)

3. Run the system

    python src/main.py

----------------------------------------------------------

Technologies Used
---------------------

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV â€“ for video/image analysis (optional)
- Scikit-learn or TensorFlow/PyTorch â€“ for ML models
- Pandas / NumPy â€“ for data handling
- Flask (if applicable) â€“ for UI or API
- Pickle (.pkl) â€“ for model serialization

----------------------------------------------------------

Use Cases
------------

- Smart city traffic signal systems
- Autonomous traffic simulations
- Emergency vehicle prioritization
- IoT sensor-based congestion control

----------------------------------------------------------

Future Improvements
